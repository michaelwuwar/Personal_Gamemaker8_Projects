# Personal_Gamemaker8_Projects
Documented my 6-year development of Gamemaker 8, including over a dozen projects ranging from parkour, shooting, meat pigeons, to LAN online battles (some of which were not completed, and I regret giving up on them)

Nevertheless, these projects are of great significance to me, and they are the greatest joy I have had in game development during my beginner years. For those who are still trying to use Gamemaker 8 (whether for entertainment or development, these projects can also be considered a bit of reference value... :-)

I know everyone is using GMS2, and all these projects are probably only a personal commemoration for me.

I am currently developing games using the Unity engine, and I have to say that gamemaker 8 has poor script execution performance and is prone to logical confusion, although this may have been caused by my previous lack of proficiency.
